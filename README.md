COMP 643: Final Project

"Evaluating Bias in News Outlets' Social Media Posts"
------------

It’s no secret that news outlets leverage social media and content to 
engage, persuade, and retain to their respective audiences. Arguably, 
the headlines and descriptive content of a social media post may be more 
influential than the content of the articles themselves. The results 
can be seen worldwide; there has been increasing distrust and tensions 
amongst citizens, polarized elections and the rise of extremist politicians, 
and a lack of awareness of fact and fiction a la fake news. The purpose of 
this study is to evaluate the top fifteen media outlets–ranging from Fox 
News to Politico–and identify how they influence their audience(s) using 
emotion, tonality, objectivity, context, and/or content in their posts.

The dataset that I am working with spans from 2012 to 2016 which spans 
two particularly important events: the 2012 (Obama/Romney) and 2016 
(Clinton/Trump) elections. I will use these two elections to frame my 
analysis and identify how the different media outlets leveraged certain 
keywords, entities, and events/timelines to engage with and influence 
their audiences around elections broadly.
